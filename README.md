# Ciao!
I'm Federico Giorgi, an Economics, Management and Computer Science student at Bocconi University, soon starting my MSc in Data Science at Columbia University.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning, AI for climate, and energy systems (especially battery storage â€“ BESS).  
ðŸš€ Here I will upload and share some projects I've dealt with which I think are interesting to explore, have fun!
